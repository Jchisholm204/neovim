# neovim
Here is my new neovim repository... I have an old private repo that uses several outdated features such as:
- COC (Conquer of Completion)
- Packer (EOL package manager)

Knowing this, I am making this repository with the goals of creating a new config that uses:
- Native LSP
- lazy.nvim (package manager)

The main goal of this was to make my neovim config work better on DRAC systems... Big thanks to the Primagen for getting me up an running with my initial config

## Using my config
Feel free... if it bugs... it works on my machines and I have 3 all running different operating systems so.. skill diff?
